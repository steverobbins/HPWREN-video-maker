HPWREN Webcam Video from Archived Images
===

A very crude script to get 24 hours worth of images from a camera like
https://www.hpwren.ucsd.edu/cameras/S/SD/mta.html?camera=stgo-w-mobo-c and
compile the static images into a video of your desired length.

Usage: `./run.sh stgo-w-mobo-c 20241027 60`

The above will generate a 60 second long video from the days worth of images
from the Santiago West camera.

Here is the result (in a lower quality)

It works on my machine :man_shrugging: YMMV

Please be nice HPWREN and don't abuse their free bandwidth.
